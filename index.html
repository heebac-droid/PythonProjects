		<h1>Portfolio for Computer Science</h1>
		<h2 id="introduction">A Short Introduction about Myself</h2>
		<p>Hello. My name is Heera Bachada and I have been interested in Computer Science for a number of years now.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I was doing GCSEs, I first learnt the programming language of Python. I was immediately enamoured with programming
		and its fundamental principlies of Abstraction and Decomposition. The satisfaction of solving a programming problem was quick and enjoyable for me. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Since beginning my A-level Computer Science course, I have started to delve into web development and the beauties of frontend and backend development. I can not wait until I learn more about
		these programming topics and sub topics, like Databases, Stacks and Data Structures and Algorithms.
		</p>
