Python Projects

This git repository is used to store my python projects in order to get better at programming with the python programming language. This repo will have lots of variety when it comes to its projects. It may range from web development to game development, just to name a few.

I will accept the majority of pull requests as long as it helps me get better at programming and teaches me a couple of new programming concepts.

Hope my code is not too unbearable.
